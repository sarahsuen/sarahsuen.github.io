						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the purpose of the design plays a big role in what font you choose. 
								It's important to identify and understand your audience to effectively convey your message/purpose. 
								Most times, people simply choose a font because it looks cool, but it's necessary to empathize with your audience. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I love the idea of a "typography styleguide", so this particular section was my favorite part of the article. 
								As someone who loves organization and consistancy, I love the fact that you could create a general document/styleguide to standardize the font sizes/types in your design. 
								This would make sense to keep your designs cohesive and more impactful.

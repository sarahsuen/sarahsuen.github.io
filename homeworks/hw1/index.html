        <li>Something I learned from <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-develop-an-eye-for-design-c5a4c64bb26c">this article</a> is that I should study the design aspects of apps. By focusing on hierarchy, content, intent, and audience, it would be effective to look from a design perspective, rather than just a user's perspective.</li>
        <li>I enjoyed looking at the Spotify app observations because I use the app every day, but haven't really thought to observe it from a design perspective. I find it interesting that there seems to be a purpose for everything, making the app more intuitive and impactful. </li>
        <li>Quote: "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
        <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, I would rate my experience reading this article an 8.</li>

							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article was super interesting because I love learning about the overlap between design and psychology. 
								I think it's so cool how UX designers can manipulate and guide what users look at and interact with through learning about psychology and how humans think and process information. 
								For example, we can focus on the different types of attention, such as spacial attention, feature-based attention, selective attention, divided attention, and sustained attention. 
								Additionally, we can learn about the different stages of information processing, including sensing, perceiving, decision-making, and acting. 
								I really liked the line, "As a UX designer we need to reduce cognitive overload" because it's important to utilize the user's attention the best we can, making the user's experience meaningful.

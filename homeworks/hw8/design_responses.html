					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that a dark pattern essentially attempts to manipulate users through UI/UX deception to make them do things they'd rather not do.
							They create a bad user experience, ultimately defeating the point of UX, carefully exploiting the user's psychology. 
							I also learned that 11 different types of dark patterns are bait and switch, disguised ads, forced continuity, friend spam, hidden costs, misdirection, price comparison prevention, privacy zuckering, roach motel, sneak into basket, and trick questions. 
							 </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I found it interesting how dark patterns are becoming more complex and less noticable. 
							Furthermore, the effects of dark patterns can be major and impact everyone in the world, rather than simply tricking someone into downloading something. 
							For example, dark patterns have become common in the political sphere through fake news and specific algorithms to boost specific stories regardless of if they were true or false.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave. Giving in to dark patterns for meeting short-term goals is not the solution." </p>

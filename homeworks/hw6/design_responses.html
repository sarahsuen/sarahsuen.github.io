						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there are so many components to animation in UX design. 
								These include the duration & speed, easing, linear motion, ease-in or acceleration curve, ease-out or deceleration curve, and more. 
								I also learned that guiding the user's attention can also be viewed as choreography, like in dance. 
								Equal interaction guides the user's attention with all of the objects, and subordinate interaction focuses on one central object to guide the user's attention. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was the 'Choreography in interfaces animation' section. 
								This is my favorite part because it connects two of my favorite things: dance (kinda) and design! 
								I love the idea that you can think of animation as choreography to guide the user's attention, 
								and I think it's so cool how you can combine what we've learned previously (like color, layout, spacing, etc) with animation (and so many more!) to guide the user's attention. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the userâ€™s attention in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another." </p>
						</li>

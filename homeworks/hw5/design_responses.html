                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From the article, I learned about how much UI animations can add to a website. 
                                Looking at each design, I found that the UI animations made the it so much more interactive, interesting, and engaging. 
                                I also learned that the animations can be implemented for several different purposes, 
                                like to emphasize something, to make swiping/transitions to a different page more interesting, or to guide the user's attention.

                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article was generally being able to look at so many unique designs as inspiration. 
                                I think it's so cool to see how each design utilized animations differently. 
                                Additionally, with each unique utilization of the animation, they all added so much to the overall design and was really impactful with what they were trying to accomplish. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite of the inspirations was the "Selected Works Transitions Experiments by Zhenya Rynzhuk for Sochnik."
                                I love the layout of the website as it emphasizes what they're trying to emphasize effectively. 
                                I also love the minimalistic approach they took on the website, and how it emphasizes the transition animations in a thoughtful way. 
                                The transition animations and hover aspect make the website a lot more engaging and interesting to look at.
                                I feel that every feature and detail of this website really makes the 'selected works' stand out, especially with their consistant color palette standing out amongst the simple white background.

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the enjoyability of reading this a 4 because while I enjoyed looking at the inspirations, there was a lack of words & descriptions to supplement the designs, so it was hard to answer the questions thoughtfully. </p>

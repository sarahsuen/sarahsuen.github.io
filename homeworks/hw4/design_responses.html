							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Generally, I learned that in order to make color accessible designs, you need to 
								add enough contrast, you can't solely rely on color, you need to consider the focus 
								state contrast, document and socialize color system, and more. For example, when adding enough contrast, 
								you need to have a background-to-text contrast ratio of at least 4:5:1. Additionally, color accessibility 
								in designs and websites are not only important ethically, but legally as well to avoid lawsuits regarding
							 	inaccessibility. </p>
						</li>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was learning about the different tips they provided 
								to make your designs more accessible. Not only did I find them helpful, but I found them 
								quite interesting as well. This is because I hadn't thought about or heard most of these tips before, 
								and I enjoyed reading about the intricacies and explanations for each tip.
